NOTES FOR TRANSLATORS

This file needs to be saved with UTF-16 LE with BOM encoding

Make sure there is a single tab space between the string key ($iEquip_Xxx_Xxx) and the translation, and that there are no additional spaces added at the end of the translation

Where you see \n contained in a string this denotes a new line, and where you see \n\n this denotes a blank line will be left between the two lines

Where you come across nested translations (those where the key names include one or more sets of {} parentheses), each {} represents an additional variable element of text which will be inserted into the translated string at the given points. Explanation of what each element of additional text contains are given on the line above each translation.

$iEquip_wc_msg_oldVersion	You appear to be loading an older version of iEquip than the one currently found in your save.\n\nPlease exit the game and ensure you have the latest version installed with nothing overwriting it.

$iEquip_help_addingItems1	Adding items to iEquip\n\nThere are two ways in which you can add items to your queues.  Firstly, you can add items directly from your Inventory, Magic or Favorites menus by simply highlighting any item (you don't need to equip it) and pressing the hotkey for the slot you want to add it to.\nAlternatively, you can enable Auto-Add and simply carry on equipping items, spells and shouts as normal and each time iEquip detects a new item being equipped it will automagically be added to the relevant queue for you.\n\nPage 1/2

$iEquip_help_addingItems2	When queue items are removed from your inventory (dropped, stored, disarmed, broken, etc) iEquip will remember them and restore them back into the previous queue if they are added back into your inventory.\n\nYou can also use the Queue Management Menus (accessed via the Utility Menu or by holding the Utility Key and double pressing the left/right/shout hotkeys) to remove items, rearrange or clear your queues\n\nEnjoy using iEquip!\n\nPage 2/2

$iEquip_help_AmmoMode1	iEquip Ammo Mode\n\nWhen you equip a ranged weapon the left hand widget will switch to displaying your currently equipped ammo. If you have enabled ammo sorting in the MCM then each time you equip a ranged weapon this will initially be the ammo with the highest base damage, the one you have most of, or the first alphabetically\n\nIn Advanced Ammo Mode, the widget also displays a second smaller icon to the side which shows the item you will re-equip when you unequip your ranged weapon.

$iEquip_help_AmmoMode2	iEquip Advanced Ammo Mode Controls\n\nSingle press left hotkey cycles the ammo\n\nDouble press left hotkey cycles the left hand item shown in the smaller icon ready for re-equipping\n\nCycling your right hand will return the left hand widget to the regular state, or you can longpress the left hotkey to re-equip the left hand item shown and swap your ranged weapon for a 1H item in the right hand

$iEquip_help_recharging1	Recharging enchanted items in iEquip\n\nLong press the left or right hotkeys to recharge the enchanted weapon in that hand. iEquip will select the most appropriate soul to use based on your MCM settings, such as whether you want to use the largest soul that will fit or use up smaller souls first, or if you want to stop iEquip from using souls which are larger than needed to fully recharge the weapon\n\nPage 1/2

$iEquip_help_recharging2	Recharging enchanted items in iEquip\n\niEquip supports GIST - Genuinely Intelligent Soul Trap by opusGlass, so in the MCM you can choose not to use partially filled gems.\n\nYou also have the option of how the current charge is displayed in the widget with either highly customizable charge meters or alternatively dynamic soul gem icons with various levels of fill\n\nPage 2/2

$iEquip_help_poisoning1	Applying Poisons In iEquip\n\nDouble press the left or right hotkeys in regular mode to apply the currently selected poison to the weapon in that hand (left poison application is blocked if a ranged weapon is equipped). In Preselect Mode hold the Utility Key while double pressing.\n\nIf the weapon is already dosed with a different poison you have the option to remove the current one before applying a fresh poison.\nIf the weapon is already dosed with the same poison the charges will stack\n\nPage 1/2

$iEquip_help_poisoning2	Applying Poisons In iEquip\n\nIf the item you are poisoning was equipped by means other than iEquip and is not displayed (auto-add turned off) the poisoning will still work and the poison widget will be updated\n\nThe Charges Per Vial and Multiplier settings below are there to allow you to match poison dosing in iEquip to any other mods you may be using, or to make poisoning a more viable playstyle. Use at your discretion!\n\nPage 2/2

$iEquip_help_throwingPoisons1	This feature allows you to equip whichever poison you currently have displayed in the Poisons slot in the widget into your selected hand.\n\nYou then simply attack with that hand as if swinging a weapon and the poison will be thrown.  Depending on your configuration you will then either equip another poison ready to throw again, or switch back to your previously equipped item(s).\n\nPage 1/3

$iEquip_help_throwingPoisons2	You can equip a different poison at any time by cycling the Poisons slot and then pressing the Throwing Poisons hotkey again.\n\nSheathing your weapons while holding a throwable poison in hand will switch you back to your previous item(s).\n\nUsing the inventory to drop the last of the poison type you are currently holding will either equip the next poison in the queue, or switch back to your previous item(s), depending on your configuration.\n\nPage 2/3

$iEquip_help_throwingPoisons3	The MCM allows you to configure various aspects of the throwable poisons to best suit your play style, and to allow you to balance the effects in your game.  You can adjust the magnitude of the poison effects, the area of the poison gas hazard, how long it lasts, and the throwing trajectory i.e. gravity factor.\n\nPage 3/3

$iEquip_help_potionGroups	Rather than having individual potions in your consumables queue, with Potion Groups turned on you have one queue item each for Health, Stamina and Magicka potions, each displaying a cummulative count of the total number of potions of that type in your inventory. iEquip curates lists of all potions of each type currently in your inventory. Holding the Consumable Key while Potion Group is displayed will consume a potion based on your MCM setting and/or display the Potion Type Selector, allowing you to select and consume a specific type of potion.

$iEquip_help_preselect1	iEquip Preselect Mode\n\nPreselect Mode is toggled by triple pressing your shout hotkey. Up to three new preselect slots will appear, one alongside each main widget slot. Your hotkeys will now cycle the preselect slot allowing you to prepare your next items/shout without actually equipping them.  You then double tap left/right/shout to equip that preelected item, or hold the left or right key to equip all preselected items at once\n\nPage 1/3

$iEquip_help_preselect2	iEquip Preselect Mode\n\nWhen you equip a ranged weapon in Preselect Mode the main left hand slot will switch to displaying your current ammo.\n\nSingle pressing the left hotkey now cycles your ammo.  To cycle the left preselect slot hold the Utility Key and double press left.\nDouble pressing the left hotkey without the Utility Key held equips the left preselected item as before, and switches the right hand to a suitable 1H item.\n\nPage 2/3

$iEquip_help_preselect3	iEquip Preselect Mode\n\nThe preselect icons will only appear for queues with 3 or more items, and you can also choose to disable shout preselect if you'd rather just preselect left/right. In addition to toggling Preselect On/Off manually, you can also choose to toggle out when Equipping All Preselected Items.\n\nWith a bit of forethought Preselect Mode opens up some great new options for tactical gameplay when the going is about to get tough!\n\nPage 3/3

$iEquip_help_quickshield1	iEquip QuickShield\n\nTriple press your left hotkey to scan your left queue for the first available shield or ward spell and equip it automatically. If you choose 'Prefer Magic' then iEquip will look for a ward spell first, and if it doesn't find one will then look for a shield. It will also check if you have a spell equipped in your right hand and if not will search for a 1H spell and equip that in your right hand.\n\nPage 1/3

$iEquip_help_quickshield2	iEquip QuickShield\n\nIf you haven't opted to 'Prefer Magic', iEquip will check what you have equipped in your right hand and if it finds anything other than a spell will look for a shield first then a ward, if it finds a spell it will look for a ward first and then a shield. If you currently have a 2H or ranged weapon equipped in your right hand iEquip will search for a suitable 1H item and re-equip the right hand as well.\n\nPage 2/3

$iEquip_help_quickshield3	iEquip QuickShield\n\nYou can also choose to allow QuickShield in Preselect Mode, and specify whether to Preselect or Equip. iEquip will do the same checks on your right hand and 'Prefer Magic' setting, but if you opted to Preselect will only switch the left preselect slot to the found shield or ward. The right preselect slot will not be switched.  Used in combination with Equip All Preselected you can begin to build quite complex three stage attack/equip strategies.\n\nPage 3/3

$iEquip_help_quickRestore1	iEquip QuickRestore and QuickBuff\n\nActivated by triple pressing your consumable key, QuickRestore will intelligently select the most appropriate Restore potion for each enabled stat, if required, based on your combat state and MCM settings. \nPotions will be used for Magicka and Stamina, while for Health both potions and spells are possible. \n\nPage 1/5

$iEquip_help_quickRestore2	iEquip QuickRestore and QuickBuff\n\nIf QuickBuff is enabled and triggered according to the settings below (2nd QuickRestore press by default), iEquip will select and consume Fortify and/or Regen Rate potions for each stat, in addition to restore potions. \nIn order to prevent potion waste, iEquip won't consume a potion if the player has a matching effect already active. Refer to the "Consumption Thresholds & Exceptions" settings on the left side for more details.\n\nPage 2/5

$iEquip_help_quickRestore3	iEquip QuickRestore and QuickBuff\n\nAdditionally, depending on your configuration, QuickBuff can also select and consume the strongest potions in your inventory to buff the various magic resistances, combat skills ot magic skills. Again, potions will only be consumed if the buff effect isn't already active on the player, or the selected potion has a stronger effect, as per the settings on the left side.\n\nPage 3/5

$iEquip_help_quickRestore4	iEquip QuickRestore and QuickBuff\n\nAs an alternative to using healing potions QuickRestore can be configured to "prefer magic", in which case iEquip will look for healing spells to restore HP. In either case you have the option to fall back on the alternative healing method if your preferred method isn't found (use potions if a spell isn't found, and vice versa). Current HP isn't checked before equipping a spell, thus allowing you to equip in advance. \n\nPage 4/5

$iEquip_help_quickRestore5	iEquip QuickRestore and QuickBuff\n\nIn the MCM you can also choose which hand will equip the spell, and enable switching back to your previous items. With this enabled, as long as you haven't cycled either hand in the meantime, triggering QuickRestore again will switch you back to your equipped items from before using QuickRestore.  You can also choose to find and consume a Restore Magicka potion upon switching back to replenish your Magicka after using a spell.\n\nPage 5/5

$iEquip_help_quickranged	iEquip QuickRanged\n\nIf you triple press your right hotkey with QuickRanged enabled iEquip will scan your right queue for the first available ranged weapon of the type selected and equip it automatically. If it doesn't find your first choice of weapon it will then look for one of the alternative type. Very handy for those situations where you need to grab a bow quickly and fire off an opening shot!

$iEquip_help_quickdualcast	iEquip Dual Equip Spells\n\nIf enabled whenever you cycle to and equip a spell from any of the selected schools iEquip will equip the same spell in both hands allowing you to switch to dual casting with a single action. You can also choose to only allow dual equipping if the spell is present in both hand queues. Dual Equip Spells is disabled in Preselect Mode

$iEquip_help_controls0	Hotkey Help\n\niEquip uses a small set of hotkeys to control a wide range of actions by utilising single, double and triple press inputs, press and hold, and key combinations.  For combinations the Utility key acts as the combo key.  So where you see 'Utility + ' in the instructions this means hold the utility key while doing the main key action as described.\n\n

$iEquip_MCM_rec_txt_realTimeStaffMeters	By default, when staff casting with constant fire staffs the charge meters update every two seconds for as long as you continue to cast. If you are experiencing script lag in combat, whilst iEquip is unlikely to be the cause, turning this off reduces the script load very slightly by only updating the meters when you start and stop casting.

$iEquip_MCM_poi_txt_poisonIndStyle	Choose how the poison charges will be displayed in the left and right slots if you have a poisoned weapon equipped.\nThe two count options will use the regular counter in either slot but with the count displayed in green.\nThe Multiple Drops option will display one, two or three drops to match the number of remaining charges, and will display three drops and a green plus sign if more than three charges remain.\nDefault: Single Drop & Count

If you choose the toggle option and keep throwing until you run out of poisons in your queue you will automatically switch back.
$iEquip_MCM_poi_txt_throwingPoisonsKey	Select a Throwing Poisons hotkey.  This is the key you press to equip a poison, switch equipped poisons if you have cycled the poison slot to select a different one, or to switch back to your previous items.

Setting this to 0 will make the poison fly straight at your crosshair, like a fireball spell for example.

$iEquip_MCM_pot_txt_checkAllEffects	For potions with multiple effects where the primary effect is not a health/magicka/stamina restore/fortify/regen effect all effects will be checked. If one or more of the other effects are found to be a health/magicka/stamina restore/fortify/regen effect the potion will be included in the Potion Groups for that effect.  If more than one matching additional effect is found priority will be given to restore effects.
$iEquip_MCM_pot_txt_prioritiseRestoreEffects	Where a potion has two or more beneficial effects give priority to 'Restore' effects so they are classed as Restore potions in the Potion Groups.
$iEquip_MCM_pot_txt_exclHostilePotions	Exclude multi-effect potions where one or more of the other effects is detrimental to the player.
$iEquip_MCM_pot_txt_exclRestAllEffects	Enable if you do not want the strongest Restore All potions to be included in your Potion Groups.  You can still add them manually to your consumables queue through the inventory menu, or if you have Auto-Add Potions enabled in the Queue Options page.  If you currently have them included in your Potion Groups and you turn this off they will be removed from the groups and added to the consumable queue if Auto-Add Potions is enabled
$iEquip_MCM_pot_txt_showSelector	When a Potion Group is displayed, hold the consumable key to: \nAlways show - Potion type selector is displayed, nothing is consumed\nConsume or Show - Consume a restore potion if required, otherwise show the selector\nAlways Consume & Show - Selector is displayed, and a restore potion is consumed if required\nPotion selection always follows your Strongest/Weakest/SmartSelect setting
$iEquip_MCM_pot_txt_selectorFadeDelay	Set the delay in seconds if nothing is consumed before the potion type selector fades out and you return to cycling the consumables queue as normal.
$iEquip_MCM_pot_txt_ConsRestoreThreshold	Restore potions will not be consumed if the target stat is above this level.\nThis applies both to holding the consumable key with one of the Potion Groups displayed to consume a restore potion, and to QuickRestore. If the target stat is below this level then which potion is consumed will be determined by the setting below.\nNB - This threshold does not apply when using the Potion Type Selector, where a restore potion will always be consumed if below 100%.
$iEquip_MCM_pot_msg_whatSmartSelect	About 'Smart Select'\nIf you are in combat and the current stat level is below the Smart Select threshold, the fastest acting potion will be consumed (best over 3 secs).\nAbove the threshold the strongest potion needed to fully restore the stat, which may be slower acting, will be consumed.\nIf you are not in combat, the weakest potion will be consumed.
$iEquip_MCM_pot_txt_PotionSelect	Choose how restore potions should be selected. This applies both to consuming through the Potion Groups and to QuickRestore.
$iEquip_MCM_pot_txt_StatThreshold	Set the stat (health/magicka/stamina) percentage threshold for Smart Select
$iEquip_MCM_pot_txt_whenEffectActive	This setting helps prevent similar potions from being wasted, when the same effect is already active on the player.  Selecting "Allow if stronger" or "Only allow in combat" will allow potions with the same effect to be consumed ONLY if they are X% stronger than the active effect, configurable in the slider below.  If 'Allow' is selected, a new potion will be consumed unconditionally every time.
$iEquip_MCM_pot_txt_aboveCurrEffectMagThreshold	Select how much stronger the new potion must be than the currently active effect before a potion is consumed.  Setting this to 0% will mean a potion will always be consumed.  Regardless of the value you set here the conditions from the setting above must have been met first.
$iEquip_MCM_pot_txt_whenNoPotions	When you run out of health, stamina or magicka potions you can choose to either fade out the icon for the relevant potion group, or hide it in which case it will not appear while cycling until you have more potions back in your inventory
$iEquip_MCM_pot_txt_consIcoFade	Choose how much you would like the consumable icon faded out by if displaying an empty potion group.\nDefault: 70%
$iEquip_MCM_pot_txt_warningOnLastPotion	The potion icon will flash twice when the final health, stamina or magicka potion in your inventory is used before fading or hiding
$iEquip_MCM_pot_txt_enblRestPotWarn	When potion groups are enabled you will be warned when you are running low on Restore potions for any group. At 5 potions remaining the group count will turn yellow, at 2 it will turn orange, and at 0 it will turn red (it will still show the correct full group count). Additionally if you have flash warning enabled the warning flash will play at each threshold.  Both of these only apply if the relevant potion group is currently displayed in the consumable slot
$iEquip_MCM_pot_txt_lowRestPotNot	In addition to the count colour and warning flash notifications will be displayed warning you at each threshold that you are running low, almost out or all out of restore potions.  These will display regardless of what is currently showing in the consumable slot.
$iEquip_MCM_pot_txt_showConsumedNotifications	Show notification messages when you consume a potion or other consumable item.  For example:\n\n`Weak Potion of Health consumed`
$iEquip_MCM_pot_txt_showNoPotionsNotifications	Show notification messages when you have none of the required potion type in your inventory.  For example:\n\n`You do not appear to have any suitable stamina potions left`
$iEquip_MCM_pot_txt_showEffectActiveNotifications	Show notification messages when the same effects of a previous potion have not yet worn off.  For example:\n\n`The effects of your previous Fortify Health potion have not yet worn off`
$iEquip_MCM_pot_txt_showStatFullNotifications	Show notification messages when the target stat is currently full.  For example:\n\n`You are currently at full health` or 'No need to QuickRestore magicka'
$iEquip_MCM_pot_txt_enblQuickRestore	QuickRestore is an advanced situationally aware feature giving you the ability to quickly restore and/or buff all three stats at once based on several variables.  Enabling `Always QuickBuff` along along with your preferred choice of buffs can, depending on the situation and your settings below, consume a large number of potions with one click for full on Combat Stims!

$iEquip_MCM_pot_txt_quickBuffControl	Always QuickBuff - QuickRestore will restore all enabled stats as required and then proceed to buff each in turn\nQuickBuff on 2nd press - The first time you activate QuickRestore it will restore all enabled stats as required.

$iEquip_MCM_pot_txt_prefHealMag	With this enabled iEquip will look for a healing spell in either hand queue and equip it according to your preferences set below. If disabled QuickHeal will look for and consume a suitable healing potion. 
$iEquip_MCM_pot_txt_useFallback	Allow QuickHeal to look for an alternative healing method if your first choice method cannot be found (ie potions instead of healing spells, and vice versa)
$iEquip_MCM_pot_txt_alwysEqpSpll	Decide whether you would like the healing spell to be equipped in the hand it is found in, in a specific hand every time or dual casting
$iEquip_MCM_pot_txt_prefHealMagIgnoreTHold	With this enabled QuickHeal will always equip the found spell, regardless of whether your health is below the threshold or not. This allows you to equip a spell in readiness if you know you are about to take damage.
$iEquip_MCM_pot_txt_swtchBck	Enabling this will allow you to switch back to your previously equipped items by activating QuickRestore a second time after you have finished healing. Only applies if a healing spell has been equipped.  If a potion has been consumed this will do nothing.
$iEquip_MCM_pot_txt_swtchBckRest	As well as switching back to your previous items QuickRestore will also find and consume a Restore Magicka potion to give you a quick boost to Magicka after using your healing spell

$iEquip_MCM_tch_lbl_dropLitTorches	Drop lit torches
$iEquip_MCM_tch_lbl_dropLitTorchBehavior	When dropping torch
$iEquip_MCM_tch_lbl_realisticTorches	Realistic Torches
$iEquip_MCM_tch_txt_showTorchMeter	When you equip a torch a meter will show in the left slot displaying the remaining torch life
$iEquip_MCM_tch_txt_torchMeterCol	Set the fill colour for the torch meter
$iEquip_MCM_tch_txt_torchMeterFillDir	Set the fill direction for the torch meter
$iEquip_MCM_tch_txt_setTorchDuration	The vanilla torch has a duration of four minutes, however quite often other mods adjust this to values which make the torches almost ever-lasting.  This allows you to reduce how long each torch will burn for.
$iEquip_MCM_tch_txt_finiteTorchLife	This removes the vanilla never-ending torch exploit whereby you could simply unequip and re-equip the same torch to reset the torch timer.  With this enabled torches will always run out when the timer expires, no matter how many times you unequip and re-equip them.  When the timer runs out one torch is removed from your inventory, and the timer resets ready for the next one.
$iEquip_MCM_tch_txt_setTorchRadius	This allows you to adjust the light radius for equippable torches. This will affect all carried torches, including those carried by NPCs. It does not affect any static torches, mod-added torches, equippable candles or lanterns.  Changes will be applied to the player's torch immediately, NPC torches will update the next time they are equipped. The reducing light radius during burnout, if enabled, is also calculated from this value.
$iEquip_MCM_tch_txt_torchesFade	As the torch timer runs out the light given off by your torch will begin to fade
$iEquip_MCM_tch_txt_reequipTorch	When your current torch runs out, if you have another one in your inventory, your next torch will be equipped automatically
$iEquip_MCM_tch_txt_realisticEquip	When equipping the next torch there will be a short, immersive delay as you fumble for it in the dark
$iEquip_MCM_tch_txt_quickLightHotKey	Assigning a hotkey here allows you to then single tap to equip either a torch or the Candlelight spell, and tap again to switch back to your previously equipped item. Whether you choose to prefer magic or not, if you don't have a torch but you do know Candlelight then the spell will be equipped instead.\nDouble tapping this key whilst you have a torch equipped allows you to drop a lit torch.
$iEquip_MCM_tch_txt_quickLightPreferMagic	Prefer to equip the Candlelight spell rather than a torch.  If you don't have enough magicka to cast the spell then you can choose below to consume a Restore Magicka potion first if you have one. If you don't have a potion, or choose not to consume, but you do have a torch then the torch will be equipped instead of the spell.
$iEquip_MCM_tch_txt_quickLightUseMagicIfNoTorch	With this enabled if you haven't opted to Prefer Magic but you have no torches left when you call QuickLight, then if you know the Candlelight spell it will be equipped this time instead of a torch.
$iEquip_MCM_tch_txt_quickLightEquipRH	If you equip a torch or spell using the QuickLight hotkey, and you currently have a 2H or ranged weapon equipped, iEquip will also scan your right hand queue for the next available 1H item and equip it at the same time as it equips the torch in your left hand.  Using QuickLight again will still switch back to whichever 2H or ranged weapon you previously had equipped.
$iEquip_MCM_tch_txt_quickLightConsumePotion	iEquip will check you have enough magicka to cast Candlelight before equipping it.  If not, then this will automatically select and consume a restore magicka potion first.
$iEquip_MCM_tch_txt_dropLitTorches	With a torch equipped double tap your left hotkey to drop the current lit torch.  If you enable the torch toggle hotkey then you can also double tap it to drop a torch.
$iEquip_MCM_tch_txt_dropLitTorchBehavior	Choose what happens with your left hand after dropping the torch.  Do Nothing - Left hand remains empty.  Torch/Nothing - Equip another torch if you have one, otherwise Do Nothing.  Torch/Cycle - Equip another torch if you have one, otherwise cycle left slot forwards. Cycle - Cycle to the next item in the left queue.  QuickShield - Equip a shield or ward, based on your QuickShield preferences.
$iEquip_MCM_tch_txt_realisticTorches	Realistic Torches has been detected in your load order.  Now if you pick up a burnt out torch from iEquip it will be replaced in your inventory with one of Realistic Torches re-craftable Burnt Out Torch misc items.
$iEquip_MCM_tch_txt_noRealisticTorches	For an even more immersive torch experience we highly recommend installing Realistic Torches by simsim899.  This mod adds the possibility of your torch being extinguished in the rain, blown out by wind or shouting, sound effects, re-craftable burnt out torches and more.

$iEquip_MCM_ui_txt_tempLvlName_Honed{}	Set your own description for items which are tempered but not by enough for them to be classed as {}. This will only be the case if you use mods which allow items to degrade or which apply random temper values to new items.

$iEquip_MCM_ui_txt_tempLvlName{}	Set your own custom name for this temper level. This only affects how the item name is displayed in the iEquip widget.\nDefault: {}
$iEquip_MCM_ui_txt_tempTierDisplay	Displays the current temper tier on a scale of 1-6 as a series of symbols (dots, diamonds, stars, etc) giving an easy 'at a glance' indication of the weapon grade rather than having to read the item name.  Also displays during cycling, and is hidden for any untempered items or those which cannot be tempered. Updates as weapon is improved or degrades.

$iEquip_MCM_ui_txt_showFadedTiers	If enabled, all six tiers in the scale are shown, with the tiers higher than the current item grade faded

The degraded section is not completely faded out, so you can still see the complete icon. Also supports weapon scaling with Signature Equipment.
$iEquip_MCM_ui_txt_tempLvlColorIcon	Allows you to choose whether or not to colour the icons as items become badly degraded within the current temper level.
